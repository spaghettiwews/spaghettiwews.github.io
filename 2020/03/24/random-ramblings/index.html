<p>Honestly, how is Microsoft this bad at search in their own apps? Don&rsquo;t they own a whole search engine&hellip; Look at these screenshots here. The start menu News app tile is showing a headline I find interesting, so I open the app and search for the exact headline text but, surprise surprise, it finds nothing. How? It&rsquo;s literally the same app that&rsquo;s updating that tile. TF.</p>

<p>I have the &ldquo;This is Rick Ross&rdquo; essentials playlist as compiled and recommended by Spotify on my home tab. Listening to &ldquo;Hustlin&rsquo;&rdquo; I must say, that beat drop and how Rozay starts his verse is still one of the most fire intros ever.</p>
<p>For his debut single, Mr. Ross could not have done better, I don&rsquo;t think. This is how I personally got introduced to that brash, braggadocious, and loud attitude we&rsquo;ve to expect from El Jefe.</p>

<p>Github seems to be having a bad time at the moment&hellip; access is slow AF - if it loads at all, that is.</p>

<p>Actually, with the way these MNOs keep pushing their social media data bundles down people&rsquo;s throats, maybe someone should make a WhatsApp bot to subscribe to podcasts where it sends you new episodes as compressed audio as they are released. I mean podcasts are really just RSS feeds&hellip; shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard right?</p>
<hr>
<p>I just clandestinely introduced my father to podcasts by downloading an episode and sending it to him via WhatsApp. It was an episode of The Daily, an interview with Dr. Fauci. I had spent part of the evening trying to debunk some fake news and conspiracy theories that he&rsquo;d forwaded to me about Africans being used as guinea pigs for vaccines, and 5G causing coronavirus. I think he was having a time believing what I was saying so I figured the podcast might save me the trouble 😁</p>

<p>This week&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/698/the-test">This American&rsquo;s Life episode</a> is a hard listen. It&rsquo;s terribly heartbreaking. We get to hear first hand accounts from people who have been directly affected by this virus in some pretty devastating ways&hellip; There&rsquo;s the story of a husband who had to leave his wife at home while she was sick because he was in essential services only to find her dead when he got back. There&rsquo;s a man completely breaking down on the phone to his brother while discussing him and his wife&rsquo;s sickness and the ever-so-real possibility of them both dying and leaving their daughter behind. And to think some still think that it&rsquo;s not so bad because, well, the fatality rate is not that high. Humans sometimes exhaust me.</p>
<hr>
<p>If there&rsquo;s any silver lining (<em>there isn&rsquo;t really</em>) to this pandemic, its that this year we have been spared the godawful April Fool&rsquo;s Day jokes and pranks from tech companies and news publications who think themselves funny.</p>

<p>Looks like we are finally going into lockdown for 21 days starting on Monday. Hoping it&rsquo;s not a case of too little, too late. We thank the president Cyril Ramaphosa for the leadership. Cde. Xerox had to wait a couple of days before announcing so that it wouldn&rsquo;t seem too obvious. Personally, I think he nailed it. Good job, sir. Good job.</p>

<p>Today, during my lunch break and after work, I went cycling again. Hadn&rsquo;t realised how long it had been since I last did. I should try and make more time for it.</p>

<p>Judging by the past few weeks&rsquo; headlines it appears that everything we are doing collectively right now, is the biggest, largest, hugest experiment of that <em>thing</em> ever done.

And to top it all off, I have newsletter spam about WFH from every other company/website out there: Trello, Heroku, Dev.to, and so on. To be clear, I&rsquo;m not complaining. I most likely subscribed to all these outlets myself, and there&rsquo;s probably some reasonable advice on the topic in there. I just had to chuckle when I realised that I&rsquo;d come across these headlines one too many times to the point where it was starting to feel like the Matrix was being glitchy. Look at this:</p>

<p>Listening to the small kids on either side of my yard shouting to each over the fences, &ldquo;MY MOM SAID I CAN&rsquo;T COME THERE, WE&rsquo;LL PLAY ANOTHER TIME!&rdquo; is quite heart-warming, and a little sad. But it&rsquo;s reassuring that other parents are treating this with the seriousness it deserves.</p>

<p>Today I started working from home for the first time ever and had a Sudden Clarity Clarence realisation that most of my work is just me sitting in front of a screen sending text and commands to other machines over an interconnected network of other machines.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Zimbabwe recorded its first death from this COVID-19 pandemic. The details surrounding the young man&rsquo;s death that came to light <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200324195057/https://dailynews.co.zw/makamba-family-fumes-over-zororos-death/">today</a> are horrific to say the least. Horrific but unsurprising, sadly. Our public health infrastructure has been in shambles for years now. The government is woefully unprepared to deal with the few cases that have been confirmed, let alone a full-on outbreak. While we may be on the verge of a serious unmitigated disaster, there&rsquo;s still a reluctance to act and take decisive action by the government. A leadership vacuum it&rsquo;s been called by some. Sigh&hellip; We are quite literally on our own.</p>

<p>I was listening to Bill Burr&rsquo;s Thursday Afternoon just before Friday Monday Morning podcast where he dropped the truest words said so far about this whole coronavirus situation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s the leak in the balloon right there. It&rsquo;s how dumb the average fuckin person is&hellip; Self quarantine is not gonna work. Please are too fuckin stupid&hellip; they are too fuckin selfish to even fuckin understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounds harsh, but just today I was arguing with someone because they want to have their kids travel across country on public transport so that they can be with them, because they miss them. Fair enough, I get that. If it were any other time this would have been perfectly fine. But the fact of the matter is that these aren&rsquo;t normal times are they. I asked somewhat rhetorically if they didn&rsquo;t care that the kids might catch the virus in public transport because we don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s infected and who isn&rsquo;t. Some people are asymptomatic for crying out loud! Was this a risk they are willing to take? &ldquo;Nah, I doubt they&rsquo;ll catch it&rdquo;, was the retort. That right there is stupidity. Then there&rsquo;s lack of consideration that if they do get infected, they will likely pass it on to other people who may be more susceptible to its effects. Who cares, so long as I see my kids right? That there is the selfishness.</p>
<p>Until we have this thing under control the most pragmatic, responsible, non-reckless thing we all can do is minimise our movements, and practise the precautions that the WHO has put out there. Unfortunately, I think it&rsquo;s all going to be for nought because people are just selfish and too stupid. I mean, just look at all the videos making the rounds on social media of young people dancing in clubs or swimming in pools while chanting, &ldquo;There is no corona here!&rdquo; 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️</p>
