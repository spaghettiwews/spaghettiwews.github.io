      <description>Diffence between tilde(~) and caret(^) in package.json? A tilde in front of the version number means that npm or yarn will update to, or use future patch versions of that library. Both the major and minor versions will not be changed. e.g. ~1.2.4 means use versions 1.2.4 &amp;lt; 1.3.0
A caret in front of the version number means that npm or yarn will update to, or use future minor/patch versions of that library.</description>

      <description>What is /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ used for? The directory is used for adding new repositories without editing the central /etc/apt/sources.list file.

      <description>props props are immutable: they are passed from the parent and are “owned” by the parent. To implement interactions, we introduce mutable state to the component. this.state is private to the component and can be changed by calling this.setState(). When the state updates, the component re-renders itself. https://linkedlist.org/react
Hooks useState() returns/uses an array to destructure its return values. The reason it uses an array is that an object would require the destructuring to be done based on its property names - an array allows us to name the values whatever we want.</description>

      <description>Download submodules for the first time git submodule update --init --recursive This pulls all submodules using the latest revision that the parent repo is tracking, and not the latest revision from the submodule itself.
 Update submodule to its latest revision/commit on origin git submodule update --remote --merge This will update the submodule to the latest version on origin and update the commit SHA hash that the parent is tracking. You will need to commit this change to persist it.</description>
