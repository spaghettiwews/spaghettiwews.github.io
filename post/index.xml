      <description>This past week I had to troubleshoot a problem with a 4 year old WordPress/CiviCRM application that had largely gone untouched since its development. Recently, it had stopped rendering the frontend and was throwing an unhelpful error message that contained what would turn out to be misleading information later, &amp;ldquo;Sorry but we are not able to provide this at the moment. Please make sure the folder is writable&amp;rdquo;.
Ummm ohkay?? Which folder?</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s an annoying caching issue I&amp;rsquo;ve been experiencing with WP All import, the WordPress CSV/XML plugin we use for importing products into WooCommerce from CSV/XML files.
The way the plugin works is that you give it a URL to a CSV/XML file that it needs to download on a regular basis in order to update product data etc.

  The issue is that once the plugin downloads the file the first time an import runs, it caches it somewhere (or the server does?</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote on this blog and today when I git cloned the blog repo and attempted to update it, I quickly realised that I could not for the life of me remember all of the commands I needed to run in order to download the theme submodule and deploy the site after writing a new post.
So, for my future self and posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake in this post I will be documenting the commands I need for installing Hugo, downloading the site and its theme(s), creating a new post and deploying it:</description>

      <description>I like well designed software. I also like free things, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure do you. Every now and again these two qualities/properties/attributes intersect and I&amp;rsquo;ll stumble upon a free, cool piece of software that I reckon may be useful to me (or you) in the future. While there&amp;rsquo;s a 90% chance that I won&amp;rsquo;t ever use most of these, here&amp;rsquo;s a running list of said applications/systems/software nonetheless:

      <title>Using a reverse proxy to provide a secure connection to a WordPress site</title>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s a reverse proxy? well, in this context, wikipedia has this to say:  In computer networks, a reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers.
In the case of secure websites, a web server may not perform SSL encryption itself, but instead offloads the task to a reverse proxy that may be equipped with SSL acceleration hardware.</description>
