      <description>27 March 2020 Looks like we are finally going into lockdown for 21 days starting on Monday. Hoping it&amp;rsquo;s not a case of too little, too late. We thank the president Cyril Ramaphosa for the leadership. Cde. Xerox had to wait a couple of days before announcing so that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t seem too obvious. I personally think he nailed it. Good job, sir. Good job.
 25 March 2020 Today, during my lunch break and after work, I went cycling again.</description>

      <description>This past week I had to troubleshoot a problem with a 4 year old WordPress/CiviCRM application that had largely gone untouched since its development. Recently, it had stopped rendering the frontend and was throwing an unhelpful error message that contained what would turn out to be misleading information later, &amp;ldquo;Sorry but we are not able to provide this at the moment. Please make sure the folder is writable&amp;rdquo;.
Ummm ohkay?? Which folder?</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s an annoying caching issue I&amp;rsquo;ve been experiencing with WP All import, the WordPress CSV/XML plugin we use for importing products into WooCommerce from CSV/XML files.
The way the plugin works is that you give it a URL to a CSV/XML file that it needs to download on a regular basis in order to update product data etc.

  The issue is that once the plugin downloads the file the first time an import runs, it caches it somewhere (or the server does?</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote on this blog and today when I git cloned the blog repo and attempted to update it, I quickly realised that I could not for the life of me remember all of the commands I needed to run in order to download the theme submodule and deploy the site after writing a new post.
So, for my future self and posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake in this post I will be documenting the commands I need for installing Hugo, downloading the site and its theme(s), creating a new post and deploying it:</description>

      <title>Creating a personal knowledgebase</title>

      <description>I recently got this fleeting idea that I should probably start keeping a repository of all the little random tidbits of technical knowledge that I learn on a daily - mostly through reading blogs and doing stuff at work - as a way of remembering these things for future use/reference. The contents would range from code snippets, bash commands that I always seem to forget, definitions (glossary of terms), ideas, concepts, really just anything I thought useful at the time.</description>

      <title>Using a reverse proxy to provide a secure connection to a WordPress site</title>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s a reverse proxy? well, in this context, wikipedia has this to say:  In computer networks, a reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers.
In the case of secure websites, a web server may not perform SSL encryption itself, but instead offloads the task to a reverse proxy that may be equipped with SSL acceleration hardware.</description>
